<h2>this is just a hello world.</h2>
i'm currently thinking of storing and organizing my personal notes here or maybe use it as an entry point for projects.
<br>
<br>
<b>general considerations:</b>
<br>
- still deciding how to structure the whole process (and this page).<br>
- it would be great to keep everything in a single place.<br>
- not everything in the repo will necessarily be presented here.<br>
<br>
<b>reminders:</b>
<br>
- check <a href = "https://pages.github.com/">this</a> for further reference.<br>
- an idea is to use a <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/">hugo template</a> (the <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/">academic</a> one seems to be quite popular).<br>
